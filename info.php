            <h3>UNiDAYS</h3>
            <h3>Cookie Policy</h3>
            <p>This Cookie Policy explains how UNiDAYS Ltd and its group companies (collectively “UNiDAYS”, "we", "us", and "ours") use cookies and similar technologies (collectively referred to in this Policy as "Cookies") to recognise you when you visit our website at <a href="http://www.myunidays.com/">www.myunidays.com</a> or app (collectively, the "Site"). It explains what these technologies are and why we use them, as well as your rights to control our use of them.</p>
            <p>We use cookies to improve the quality of our Site, our marketing and the service that we offer you. Basically, we want to make your experience with us as amazing as we can, and cookies help us do this.</p>
            <h3>What are cookies?</h3>
            <p>Cookies are small data files which are placed on your computer when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by website owners in order to make their websites work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information. These cookies store and sometimes track (depending on what the cookie is seeking to achieve) information about your use of the Site.</p>
            <p>Cookies set by the website owner (in our case, UNiDAYS) are called "first party cookies". Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called "third party cookies". Third party cookies enable third party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website (e.g. like advertising, interactive content and analytics). The parties that set these third-party cookies can recognise your computer both when it visits the website in question and also when it visits certain other websites.</p>
            <p>Some of the cookies we use last only for the duration of your web session and expire when you close your browser. Other cookies are only used where you ask us to remember your login details for when you next return to the Site and will last for a longer duration. We set out in a bit more detail below how these different kinds of cookies work and what we use them for.</p>
            <h3>Why do we use cookies?</h3>
            <p>The cookies used by UNiDAYS are explained below. We have explained the cookies in categories rather than individually as, to be honest, it makes a lot more sense this way and we think it is a far more useful way of explaining what we are doing.</p>
            <p>We use first party and third-party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our Site to operate, and we refer to these as "essential" or "strictly necessary" cookies. Other cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our members to enhance the experience on our Site. Third parties serve cookies through our Site for advertising, analytics and other purposes. This is described in more detail below.</p>
            <p>If you have any questions about our use of cookies or other technologies, please email <a href="mailto:info@myunidays.com">help@myunidays.com</a></p>
            <p>We are continually striving to develop improved ways of managing your cookie preferences. As new technologies and solutions emerge, this Cookie Policy may be updated to reflect any such advances in technology and preference management tools. We may also update this Cookie Policy from time to time in order to reflect, for example, changes to the cookies we use or for other operational, legal or regulatory reasons. Please therefore re-visit this Cookie Policy regularly to stay informed about our use of cookies and related technologies. Our <a href="/US/en-US/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a> can provide you with further details about how we use any personal information you give us, although please note that not all information captured by using cookies will identify you.</p>
